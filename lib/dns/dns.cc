/**
 * This is an isolated stub DNS resolver for the CHERIoT network stack.
 *
 * This resolver supports A, AAAA, and CNAME queries on IPv4, for recursive DNS
 * servers. We assume that the recursive resolver recurses into CNAME records.
 *
 * Support for IPv6 is left for future works.
 *
 * Since the resolver plugs directly with the firewall, it needs to know its
 * own IP address, the IP address of the DNS server, its own MAC address, as
 * well as the MAC address of the DNS server (or that of the gateway if the
 * server is outside of the local network). The MAC address of the device is
 * obtained from the firewall. The IP address of the device, of the DNS server,
 * and the MAC address of the server/gateway are obtained from DHCP and ARP,
 * whose corresponding packets are also forwarded to this resolver.
