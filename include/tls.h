/**
 * Creates a new TLS connection.  Returns null on failure or a sealed TLS
 * connection object on success.
 *
 * The state for the TLS connection will be allocated with `allocator`.  The
 * connection will be made to the host identified by the connection capability.
 * This must authorise a TCP connection.  Once the connection is made, the
 * certificates will be validated against the trust anchors provided via the
 * `trustAnchors` parameter, which contains a pointer to an array of
 * `trustAnchorsCount` trust anchors.
 *
 * This can fail if:
 *
 *  - The connection capability is not a valid TCP connection capability.
 *  - The allocator capability does not have enough quota to satisfy the
 * allocations.
 *  - The remote host is not accessible.
 *  - The remote host's certificate is not trusted by the trust anchors.
 *
 *  This function assumes that the trust anchors are valid and will not be
 *  freed during the call.  If this is not the case, then this function can
 *  abort *without* gracefully freeing the resources it has allocated. These
 *  are allocated with the callee's allocator and so the caller is able to
 *  mount a denial of service attack on itself via a concurrent free.
 *
 * Known problems with this API:
 *
 *  - The BearSSL types are leaked into the API.
 *  - The reason for the failure is not reported.
